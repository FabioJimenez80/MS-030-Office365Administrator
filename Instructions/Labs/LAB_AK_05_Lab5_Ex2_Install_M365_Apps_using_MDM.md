# Module 5 - Lab 5 - Exercise 2 - Deploying Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise using Mobile Device Management

You have taken on the persona of Holly Dickson, Adatum's Enterprise Administrator, and you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. In this exercise, you will perform the tasks necessary to manage a Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installation using Mobile Device Management. 

Starting in Windows 10, version 1709, you can use a Group Policy to trigger auto-enrollment to MDM for Active Directory (AD) domain-joined devices.

The enrollment into Intune is triggered by a group policy created on your local AD and happens without any user interaction. This means you can automatically mass-enroll a large number of domain-joined corporate devices into Microsoft Intune. The enrollment process starts in the background once you sign in to the device with your Azure AD account.

In the first task, Holly adds Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise as a managed app.

In tasks 2 and 3 in this exercise, Holly extends the Hybrid Azure AD domain-join setup to enroll devices for cloud-based Mobile Device and Mobile Application Management (MDM and MAM).

In the final task, you will verify the installation of Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise.

### Lab Setup

### Task 1 - Add Microsoft 365 apps to Windows 10 devices with Microsoft Intune

Holly wants to add Microsoft 365 apps automatically to managed devices. To manage devices using Microsoft 365, Adatum has purchased Enterprise Security + Mobility E5 licenses. In this task, Holly assigns on of these licenes to a user. Then, she add Microsoft 365 apps to managed devices and verifies the installation.

21. In the **Review + create** page, select **Create**.


### Task 2 - Verify auto-enrollment requirements

To ensure that the auto-enrollment feature is working as expected, you must verify that various requirements and settings are configured correctly. The following steps demonstrate required settings using the Intune service:

1. From the previous task, you should still be logged into the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center** as Holly.

2. In the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Devices**.

3. In the **Devices** blade, under **Device enrollment**, select **Enroll devices**.

4. In the **Enroll devices** blade, verify that **Windows enrollment** is selected, and select **Automatic enrollment**.

### Task 3 - Configure the auto-enrollment Group Policy for a single PC

Holly wants to show how the new auto-enrollment policy works. This is not recommended for the production environment in the enterprise. For bulk deployment, you should deploy the same setting using an Active Directory domain group policy object.

**Note:** Continue with this task only, after you finished the steps under **Lab setup**. If the update process takes, is not finished yet, you may return to this exercise at a later point in the course.

1. Switch to **LON-CL3**.

2. You should still be logged into LON-CL3 as **Adatum\Administrator**.

   **Note:** In Windows 10, version 1903, the MDM.admx file was updated to include an option to select which credential is used to enroll the device. **Device Credential** is a new option that will only have an effect on clients that have installed Windows 10, version 1903 or later. The default behavior for older releases is to revert to **User Credential**. **Device Credential** is not supported for enrollment type when you have a ConfigMgr Agent on your device.

9. Close **Local Group Policy Editor** and sign out from LON-CL3.

### Task 4 - Verify successful enrollment and app deployment

In this task, Beth Burke verifies, that the computer is enrolled for Mobile Device Management and that the Microsoft 365 apps are installed.

**Note:** It may take 5 minutes or more, until the device registration finishes.

1. Log in to **LON-CL3** as **Beth@xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** (where xxxUPNxxx was the unique UPN name assigned to your tenant, and xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx was the name your lab hosting provider assigned to the custom domain) account with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Select the **Windows (Start)** icon in the lower left corner of the taskbar, select **Settings**.
